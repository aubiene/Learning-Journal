### Estimated Hours:

Around 4 hours

### Content Insights:


I refreshed my knowledge of the key concepts of front-end Web Design and development such as elements, attributes, CSS, and JavaScript. 
I also expanded my understanding on some of the key concepts of back-end development like NPM, this was mentioned first link above, so I watched other videos on it.
I learnt that NPM, is a package manager for Node.js that is used to share packages and provides links to external libraries and databases.

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights:


After completing the practical, I feel like I may not have gained any real significant insights, apart from a better understanding of NPM. 
While I had heard of NPM before, I realised that I did not fully grasp the concept of what is does until now.  I would also like to note that I really liked the NPM crash course video in the third link above, as it was a step by step instruction and allowed me to follow along, I might keep this in mind for future learning.
